<cmath>:
    The pow() function is just choosing between the builtin pow functions depending on the parameters passed.
        __builtin_powf()/powl() can be used instead of pow() without including cmath, provided the use of parameters is correct.
        powf: floats, powl: long doubles.
<vector>:
    builds on STL Vector, operator[] can be overloaded as demonstrated here.
