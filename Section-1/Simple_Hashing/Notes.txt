Hash Table:
    Storing data in an array with the Hash Function values as the index
Hash Function:
    Function which takes in the key and returns the value to be used as index.
Direct Access Table / Trivial Hashing:
    Storing data in an (BIG) array with the key as the index
    i.e. the hash function: f(x) = x
Collisions:
    When two keys result in the same hash function values, they can be said to 'collide', solutions:
        1. Seperate Chaining
        2. Open Addressing:
            Double Hashing
