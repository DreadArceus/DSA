Sliding Window is like a window of memory addresses we are observing, 
    when moved to the right, ditch the left edge and add on the new right edge.
But when used along with preprocessing (such as Prefix Sum Arrays),
    the window doesnt slide that way, all of it is destroyed and then made anew in a sense.
    for example, in a 2d matrix, a 2d window when used with prefix sum arrays,
        instead of removing the left edge and adding the new right edge,
        it would get the whole window's sum again using the prefix sum array

I have decided to call this combination of the Sliding Window Algorithm and preprocessing by a new name...

"Teleporting Window Algorithm"
